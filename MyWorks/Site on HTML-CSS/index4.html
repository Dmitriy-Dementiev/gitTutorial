    <h2>Business and Entreprice</h2>
    <span>Concept and essence</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
<p>One of the main elements of a market economy, without them, the state cannot develop intensively.
   Business and entrepreneurship affect the state economic growth rate, structure,
   volume and quality of gross national product.
   One of the most common definitions today says that a business is any activity aimed at making a profit,
   carried out by selling goods and services that are in demand.
   Entrepreneurship or entrepreneurial activity - an independent activity of citizens
   and their cooperations related to risk, carried out at their own responsibility, aimed at generating income
   from the use of property, sale of goods, performance of work or the provision
   of services by persons, in accordance with the law.
   It is difficult to separate these concepts, since they are equivalent, however, of course, there are differences.
   Entrepreneurship as the basis of business involves its own business, which is always associated with the danger 
   of losing it and losing its material and intellectual resources.

    <span class="title">Payment</span><br>
    <span class="heading">Payment through the online store</span>
    <p>An online store where you can pay with an international
       Visa,MasterCard, or other payment ssystem plastic card,
       uses the acquiring service.</p>
    <span class="heading">Payment process</span>
    <p>The payment process is carried out through an 
       acquiring bank,which can independently carry out such operations.
       This is an electronic system that provides interaction between
       the online store,the partner bank(acquirer), the international
       payment system of the Ministry of Railways and the issuing-bank
       that issued the card.</p>
    <span class="heading">The risks</span>
    <p>As you can see, the process includes multi-stage authorization.
       This ensures that only your order amount and bank commission,if any,
       will be debited from your card.
       Since the calculation is carried out through a secure form of payment,
       and the information is transmitted through closed communication channels,
       you can be sure of complete confidentiality.Neither online store managers
       nor online hackers will be able to see your billing information.
