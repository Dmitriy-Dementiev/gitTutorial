    <h2>How to open a business from scratch&#10067;</h2>
    <span>Now we will tell you in detail&#10149;</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
     <span><h3><strong>Where to begin√</strong></h3></span>
First you need to decide on the direction of activity.
In a general sense,all business options can be divided 
into three categories:
<br>
<br>
&bull;craft;
<br>
&bull;sales;
<br>
&bull;agency;
<br>
<br>
<h3>Let's consider in more detail each category</h3>
<br>
<p>Craft - in this case, in order to start a business from scratch, you need to choose a profession for yourself in order to become at least a self-employed person and stop working for an uncle.
The options in this case are simply a great many. You can become,for example, a photographer, a programmer, a manicurist, a masseur,a designer, a copywriter, or even a guide.
Having become a specialist in your field, you can, if you wish, start training courses or open your own company, a beauty salon or a bureau.
<br>
<br>
Agency - agent business is attractive to many precisely because of its low entry threshold. The most popular destinations are advertising agencies, travel agencies, celebration events, translation agencies, 
insurance agencies, recruiting agencies, real estate agencies. Most likely, you don&rsquo;t even have to learn a new profession, because the main goal of the agency is to bring together interested people (for example, the employer and the candidate or the landlord and tenant)
<br>
<br>
Sales - you can launch your own online store. This does not require special knowledge, even if in the beginning you encounter difficulties in creating your own website, 
you can always start by selling goods on social networks and on specialized platforms such as OLX and Avito. And Google will help you with the search for a supplier of goods.

<p><h3>Trade&mdash;The most attractive niche for start-up entrepreneurs,
which allows you to organize a stable income according to a simple commercial scheme.
<br>

Most of the products on the global market are made in China.

now Chinese products have become more functional and durable, while maintaining a low cost.
<br>
<br>

Chinese goods are not very expensive, which allows you to set a margin of up to 500-700&#65285;.
It should also be noted a wide range of markets. You can find any product from Chinese manufacturers,
ranging from useful household trivia to high-tech gadgets, which allows the entrepreneur to find the most optimal and sought-after niche.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
&bull;find goods in China at a wholesale price;
<br>

<div id="faq">
  <div>
    <span class="title">Payment</span><br>
    <span class="heading">Payment through the online store</span>
    <p>An online store where you can pay with an international
       Visa,MasterCard, or other payment ssystem plastic card,
       uses the acquiring service.</p>
    <span class="heading">Payment process</span>
    <p>The payment process is carried out through an 
       acquiring bank,which can independently carry out such operations.
       This is an electronic system that provides interaction between
       the online store,the partner bank(acquirer), the international
       payment system of the Ministry of Railways and the issuing-bank
       that issued the card.</p>
    <span class="heading">The risks</span>
    <p>As you can see, the process includes multi-stage authorization.
       This ensures that only your order amount and bank commission,if any,
       will be debited from your card.
       Since the calculation is carried out through a secure form of payment,
       and the information is transmitted through closed communication channels,
       you can be sure of complete confidentiality.Neither online store managers
       nor online hackers will be able to see your billing information.
